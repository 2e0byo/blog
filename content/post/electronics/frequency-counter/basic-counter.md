Now that we have a working counter and display the next thing to look
at is the timebase.  The timebase I built when first working on this
counter is odd.  It uses, for some reason, a 3.2768MHz crystal divided
by (2^16 \* 10n) to get a gate _pulse_ which is a multiple of 1s, then
further divided and decoded by a 3-to-8 decoder to generate pulses
which latch the counter onto the display, and reset the counters.
This much was copied from
[EMRFD](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Experimental_Methods_in_RF_Design.html?id=GGUJAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y)
but without the intelligence that excellent book expects: obviously,
this solution is fine for a quick gate but highly tedious for the long
gates I decided to add, as well as being useless for
pulse-width-counting, which I wanted to make it do like [G0UPL's
counter](http://www.hanssummers.com/counter.html)â€”the other project I
copied rather blindly.  I'd be much better off with a 10 or 20MHz
crystal and drop the needless 2^16 counter.  But more on that later
when I finish it.
 
After wiring and rewiring, and wiring in circles, we have a switchable
timbase, using real hcmos logic, and a gate, using improvised diode
logic (more ICs in the post).  This involved one of those
multipole-rotary switches.  I have a few, and none of them make sense.
So I took the case off: it seems this is a three-pole four-throw
device, but with the the contacts all so oxidsed most don't conduct.
I cleaned them off:

{{< /gallery >}}
{{< load-photoswipe >}}

And then took out two of the sliders.  Now if we connect the three
poles together we have a twelve-way one-pole switch, which is much
more useful here.  I also removed the completely unneccasery third
connection to the hc138 3-to-8 decoder, as two inputs produces 2^2 = 4
outputs, which for 3 pulses is fine.  Then we need RTL as the 138 is
an active-low device, but the reset and gate pulses are active-high.
Connect it all together and we can count our own timebase:

Now what is that last digit about?  Surely, unless it drifts .2Hz
(this is actually timebase/10) during the count it should always read
0?  But at any rate, it's clearly working.  I didn't show you any
photos when things weren't. For another project I need to know how
fast one of those OpenWRT boards can bit-twiddle.  So I toggled a gpio
with the shell (just echo '1' or '0' to the pseudo-file):

{{<gallery caption-effect="fade" >}}
	{{< figure thumb="-thumb" src="/img/dscf11421.jpg" caption="OpenWrt Board">}}
	{{< figure thumb="-thumb" src="/img/dscf11431.jpg" caption="Waveform">}}
	{{< figure thumb="-thumb" src="/img/dscf11441.jpg" caption="Count">}}
{{</gallery >}}

About 1.6KHz.  That's more than quick enough.  Here's another shot
with the brightness turned up (the change in value is unrelated, it
was not stable!):

And we have a working (if not at all finished) peice of test
equipment.  I've sorted out the control logic in my head and half on
paper, so that will follow shortly when some flip-flops and logic
arrive to build it.
