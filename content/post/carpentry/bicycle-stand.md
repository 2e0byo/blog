After a few months of balancing my bicycle between two walls where
once, it would seem, was a pantry, it got too annoying.  Ideally one
would like some kind of stand to hold the bike out the way,
vertically.  The internet turns up
[many](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vertical+bike+stand+wood&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)
such designs. After a trip around the rather poor selection of wood
available at B&Q (the only place open), I settled on something
slightly different—an L-shaped half-lapped frame with wooden chocks to
space it, and the bicycle balanced with just a small _inward_ turning
moment counteracted by its own weight.  

After thinking about this for a week I decided it would be plenty
stable enough without the need to to make it a 'T' or inverted '7'.
Lest I sound entirely stupid, imagine the moment of putting the bike
in, where its own weight is supported (and so can't act); the only
force acting on the stand is presumably the front wheel pushing it
away, and the stand bouncing all the time would be annoying.  As it
happens I was completely wrong about this assumption, but
anyhow. 

First off, the half-lap joints: as you can see, the timber I ended up
with is about 1/2" wider than the depth of my Tenon saw, so the last
1/2" was taken off rather clumsily with a cross-cut panel saw and then
pared down with a chisel:[^1] 

[^1]: It could just have been pared.  But at the time I didn't have a
    bench, and was a bit rusty.

Assemble, true up, glue and temporarily clamp against the try square,
and then add two screws to hold the alignment:

…remove clamp, three more screws and give it all a while to get some
handling strength.  Meanwhile, the chocks—I eyeballed the chamfer and
cut it off rather roughly, but the worst thing was trying to drill
square.  Years of relying on a pillar drill do not help. Turns out
it's mainly about sight-lines: the first block was by far the worst,
but after that it went relatively smoothly (these are all from the
exit side). \[gallery ids="254,255" type="rectangular"\] There are no
photos of the highly irritating next stage, but by some juggling I
managed to get two chocks bolted through the bottom to line the whole
thing up and hold the bottom wheel.  At this point I realised that it
was too short to put a chock _above_ the top wheel whilst still
maintaining balance—I must have slightly mismeasured the balance
point.  But we don't actually need one there, so I did a rough guess
at the top chock position and then drilled a set of parallel holes:

Incidentally, someone is probably going to point out that I'm not
drilling into scrap.  It's true, and bad---but I don't _have_ any
scrap, the drill bit is sharp, and you can avoid _bad_ breakout damage
if you're careful. Here's a shot with the whole thing together:

Which was really rather stable.  Indoors on the lino it lacked
horizontal stability, so I added two stabilising bars from leftover 2"
stock (whence the chocks):

And there we have it: not bad for a day's work without access to a
proper workshop.  In use it takes about 3-4" of movement to generate a
turning moment away from the stand, so I added a bungee on top to
catch it if someone knocks the bike.  And it's _much_ nicer to come
home to than wrestling the thing round the corner was before.
