[The first shot](/post/carpentry/workbench) at a workbench sat dormant for a fair while. Meanwhile it got
cold---very very cold.  Then it got wet---very very wet.  Then it got hot---very
very hot.  And how did my nice, carefully chosen unwarped 1" planks look after
that?  A pretty sorry state. Even the laminated legs had moved slightly (next
time for lamination I need more glue).  Then I discovered that I could get 6x2s
from MKM building supplies.  I rang to ask about stock and he checked---'yes,
I've got 3,500m in stock at the moment'.  Madly I decided to take the trolley
out again.  Very madly, as MKM deliver for free, and if you plead with them they
will select vaguely straight timber for you.  Instead of which I lugged this lot
home:

it was blowing a gale (alright 'gusting 4') and we had some hairy moments, but
we made it.  First thing was to make somewhere to store tools:

OSB is horrible stuff, but it's cheap and takes nails well.  I do not actually
remember where this board came from, but I think it was dragged horribly back on
a trolley like everything else.  Then it was a matter of squaring up some stock
and making the cross pieces.

{{</gallery>}}

Pared to fit precisely, dry assembled, scored and cut; and then glued and
nailed:

The top cross piece had, I think, to be ripped to 6" from an 8" plank, which is
rather hard work, particularly without a proper bench or a decent ripsaw.
But with the Â£5 construction site saw we got there.  There are two runners on
top of the legs:

all glued together it's a substantial frame:

Then the long side aprons could be planed square and flat (where the joints will
be, and for the vice, but left rough elsewhere), the slots cut and the whole
thing trial assembled:

{{<figure src="/img/workbench2/test_side.jpg">}}

And then, of course, planed flat all over.  I was using small wedges to keep the
whole thing flat (by eye) on the patio, and the apron is merely push fitted.

At this point the bench is a useable (and very heavy) table:

The next day, the same thing can be repeated, and the whole thing planed flat by
eye:

    {{<figure src="/img/workbench2/front.jpg">}}
	{{<figure src="/img/workbench2/both_sides.jpg">}}
{{</gallery>}}

And the next day, the cross pieces which try to stop the whole thing bouncing
around:

    {{<figure src="/img/workbench2/cross.jpg">}}
	{{<figure src="/img/workbench2/all crosses.jpg">}}
{{</gallery>}}

And here it is, in situ, with the top unfinished:

## Motivational Training

I have no photos of the rest of the construction until (most of) the top was on.
The reason for this is that at the time I was trying to get married.  This was
made difficult by the sudden discovery that the plague was causing an epidemic
of bigamous marriages (or something of the kind), to counter which it was
necessary to close down all the registry offices whilst insisting on giving a
month's notice before getting married.  For good measure they closed the
churches as well, so even if one *had* given notice there was nowhere actually
to get married.

The reasoning was very simple, and very logical.  In normal times a notice is
pinned up to a board in a building nobody every goes near, and this qualifies as
informing the community of impending nuptials in order that any trifling
objections (but she's still married to me!) can be sorted out before the 'I
object' (which is of course only found in the Prayer Book service anyhow:
Catholics are not *allowed* to object).   Since the Plague was causing such a
spate of such marriages, a compromise position was eventually reached:  notices
could be given and pinned up in a building, but nobody was allowed actually to
enter the building in question, for fear of contracting a bigamous marriage in
the process.

This solution, which was reached by a great art of bureaucratic endeavour, owed
nothing to the mornings spent pleading, arguing, insisting and generally
bothering the *notary local*.  Indeed Providence simply arranged things; such
that after a particularly long and insistent conversation I was assured that
*nothing* would be possible for at least a month; and that afternoon they rang
to arrange an appointment.  But after such mornings one was in such a temper
the only thing to do was to go and plane great amounts off the great planks
until everything was square.  But I was in no mood for photographs, and there
are none, until the bench was put to use building wedding furniture in the mad
week before the thing itself.  But that's [another post](/post/carpentry/wedding).
