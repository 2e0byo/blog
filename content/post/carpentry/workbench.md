# Background

This workbench is built almost exactly to a [published
design](https://www.theenglishwoodworker.com/the-english-workbench/)
and following the videos.  One has to _buy_ the videos.  This is the
first time I have ever done anything like this, and it was a very good
idea.  Buy them; watch them; copy them.  Unless one is very lucky one
simply doesn’t get to watch a good craftsman up close very often, but
the ability to pause, zoom, replay, and see _exactly_ how to position
your hands and body when paring with a chisel, for example, is worth
any amount of textbooks.

Notably:

- it's made from pine.  Pine, apparently, has the advantages (besides being
  cheap) of gripping better, being lighter, and not mattering.  So you can put a
  nail in it to hold a workpiece in place and not worry.
- stability comes not from weight, but from the massive (6") front apron and its
  dovetails
- the front dovetails are made with a gap (about 1/16") to allow for movement in
  the timber.  (This makes sense as the notched edge is what provides the
  bracing, and the apron will get deeper rather than longer with moisture).

That said I’ve changed a few things.  I have a small shed, so the
bench had to be small---6’ in length, not the enormous 12’ of that
design.  Likewise, it is only 2’ deep.  I have a record quick-release
vice I found cheap on Ebay, so that went in instead of the wooden
screw and handmade vice here.  I couldn’t get 4x4s for the legs, so
mine are laminated up from 2x4s; and I bought _all_ of the timber
rough sawn to force me to get efficient at planing up stock.

# Frame

First, we need some timber.  I took the
[trolley](/post/engineering/how-to-move-a-piano) along to B&Q, simply
because it is just around the corner and I knew of nowhere else, and
bought what I could find: a lot of 2x4s, some 1x8 planks, and some CSL
to make up a pair of sawhorses.

I had a few days before the PhD began, so finishing was always a bit
unlikely.  But first off we need some sawhorses.  I made this design
up late at night:

	{{<figure src="/img/workbench/sawhorse3.JPG">}}
	{{<figure src="/img/workbench/sawhorse4.JPG">}}
{{</gallery>}}

It's a bad idea, as the legs are far too far apart, but it does work.

Then to nail down the planks temporarily and cut the legs:

{{<figure src="/img/workbench/leg_blanks.JPG">}}

and plane them flat and square (we'll dimension them later when glued
up):

{{<figure src="/img/workbench/leg_blanks_planed.JPG">}}

Here is my first attempt, which took about an hour:

{{<figure src="/img/workbench/legs_laminated1.JPG">}}

It needed the screws to pull it in, and even then there were some
cracks.  It turns out from watching the vides there is just oh so much
I didn't do correctly: plane at a silly angle, not flush with the
wood, and no idea how to take out the high spots, lightly cup the
surface and then finish off flush.  Really, buy the videos and watch
them---they're excellent.  But anyhow, on my third attempt, and after
_slightly_ cupping the glued faces to achieve perfection, there was
barely any visible line at all:

{{<gallery caption-effect="fade">}}
	{{<figure src="/img/workbench/legs_laminated2.JPG">}}
	{{<figure src="/img/workbench/legs_laminated3.JPG">}}
{{</gallery>}}

and side by side the difference is obvious:

{{<figure src="/img/workbench/legs_laminated_comparison.JPG">}}

So now they could all be glued up:

	{{<figure src="/img/workbench/legs_laminated_gluing.JPG">}}
	{{<figure src="/img/workbench/legs_laminated_all.JPG">}}
{{</gallery>}}

By this point I was very unwell with something or other, and the PhD was
starting in a few days.  The workbench sat unloved on the trestles in the shed
for the best part of a year, until it was turned into an excellent bench under
the motivational training of government functionaries; of which more in [part 2](/post/carpentry/workbench2)
