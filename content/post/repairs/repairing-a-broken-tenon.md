This posed something of a problem: what do you do when a pinned tenon
breaks?  The joint was too broken just to glue, neither surface was
flat, and the dowels were in the way.  In the end I decided to dowel
it with three dowls, to leave as much of the broken tenon intact as
possible.  Dowled joints are _easy_ on flat, square workpeices.  On
jagged tapering workpeices, now... With a quarter-inch chisel I cut
flats to mark on and marked the three holes on both mortice and tenon.
Then I made a jig to make drilling square a bit easier.  This
wood—generic African hardwood—is like fibreboard.  The lip and spur
bit just spun on the surface:

Then the mortice was drilled out on the pillar drill, drilling the two
top holes, pinning the jig in place, and using it to drill the bottom,
as that landed on so much jagged break:

Top hole is a little close for comfort. Reassamble the other legs
first, so the chair can pull itself square:

And then 'walk' it in with a clamp (_don't_ whack it in with a
mallet).  All told, not too bad:

It's not given out yet this week...
