Like many ageing Honda Civics our VSA and ABS lights have been coming on
sporadically for the last few months.  Now they're stuck on all the time.

First I suspected the battery, so I duly measured the no-load voltage (~12.6V:
not great, but not awful either), the voltage dip when running the fuel pumps,
(~11.6V) and the voltage dip when starting (briefly around 10V, but I didn't
have a scope on it).  Yep, the battery is ageing.  What about its internal
resistance?  Everyone did this at school, right---you put a load across the
battery, measure the current through the load and the voltage across the
terminals before and after; then you assume that voltage was dropped across the
internal resistance and do R=V/I.  The trouble is that the voltage drop is tiny,
so you need a reasonable current.  I couldn't find any decent loads, but *any*
load will do if you have an ammeter in series, so I disconnected the negative
lead and used the car itself.  Since the alarm promptly started going off (next
time lock the car door!) that formed one data point, and then I turned the
running lights on for the other.  With the multimeter in relative mode even the
subtraction was done for me:

| dV    | I    | R      |
|-------|------|--------|
| 0.06V | 0.9A | 67mOhm |
| 0.3   | 6A   | 50mOhm |

Neither is ideal, but both are perfectly respectable for a starting battery.
Anyhow, it seems that measuring battery health this way is a pretty dark
science---one paper I saw claimed that the usual means of measuring AC impedance
and then taking the real component gave wildly different values from the DC
resistance, so when I found the batteries had died (!) in my capacitor ESR meter
I put it back.  It's not calibrated, so I would have had to find a bunch of
10ohm resistors to make up a 100mOhm calibration unit, anyhow.

Further confirmation that it's not the battery came when trying with a charger
across it, and a lithium ion jumpstarter which once rescued us on a motorbike on
the side of the road.  The warning lights refused to go away.  There's a
procedure for resetting them without a code reader---ground the SDS pin on the
odb connector or stuff some foil in the socket for the same purpose on the
fusebox and play with the brake and the key.  It clearly worked, but the light
came straight back again.

Thus I turned to the sensors themselves.

All the wheels are different, to be annoying, and I had to work one wheel at a
time as the pavement grounds my low profile jack on one side.  I also jacked
from the pinch welds for the first time and promptly bent them flat, but never
mind, they'll work just as well like that.  I mostly use them for axle stands
anyway.

With some wires and a lot of annoying poking around I managed to get connections
to both the hidden pins and the hidden sockets.  Front right worked perfectly:

My notes claim the sensor measured 1.5 M Ohms, but on the basis that the other
three working sensors were in the 280-300k range I wonder if I didn't misread.
Here you can see the search protocol from the abs controller:

(Apologies for the trace being upside down.)  There are two 11V peaks, which
clearly are used to measure drawn current, and then if the sensor is detected
the line is held high at 11v and the wheel movements are modulated on to it.
The rear right sensor had the two peaks (so the wiring's good) but nothing I
could do could make it stay high after that.  The sensor also measures 2 M Ohms
(hence the comment about misreading the front right).

Thus a new sensor is in the post for Â£10, and we'll have to see if it can be
fitted easily.  These sensors are very simple---hall effect probes---so
hopefully the inside of the drum isn't full of rust or something preventing it
working.  The *outside* of the brake and the whole rear of the car certainly
shows its age.

And digital oscilloscopes are really good fun---this would have been a nightmare
with the old crt scope.  Now I just need to learn how to take screenshots
without the screenshot bar on the right hand side...
