There is a nasty thing out there called 'built in obsolescence', which
is supposed to cure the fact that most things are actually made quite
well and would last a long time if left to themselves.  Here is a
microwave:

Well at any rate, there's most of a microwave. The 'cancel' button was
no longer working. What makes me think the entire microwave is being
held hostage by a Â£0.03 switch? Let's take the case off and have a
look:

Microwaves are about the only bit of domestic equipment which will
_easily_ electrocute you. So we stay a long way away from all the high
voltage lines:

 Helpfully, a 'schematic' is provided. It would be nice if it actually
 _told_ us something about the 'digital programmer circuit'.

A multimeter on the back of the switch and, sure enough, mechanical
failure.  Of course, they went and glued the knob on, so we can't just
unscrew the board, but need to desolder it:

The only similar switch I could find was on
another board saved from something long thrown out and had to be
desoldered.  And of course, the shaft was the wrong length, and I
noticed _after_ soldering it on, so it had to be cut and filed _in
situ_.

And there we have it.  Put it back together _carefully_...

...and it now 'cancels'.  All for a switch which, in the end, cost me
nothing.  I wonder how many of these are shipped around the world to
bury them each year because of something as simple?
