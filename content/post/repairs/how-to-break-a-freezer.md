I arrived back yesterday to discover that the fridge, or more
specifically the fridge-freezer, had been off for at least a
week.[^1]  The same week, coincidentally, that temperatures in the range
of southern France on a cool day have lead to pantograph cables all
falling off.  Oops.  Hopefully the repairs will be more heat-tolerant...
Thus in this heat wave[^3]—well, it was certainly warm—the inside of the
fridge/freezer got to goodness knows what temperature (fridges make
good beer-brewing ovens, as google will show).

[^3]: In fact, the same failure occured over the _Christmas_ holidays,
    and *everything in the freezer was fine*.  I think the house might
    have been _colder_ than the freezer normally is...

And as to the state of the freezer—well.  Once one has bagged all the
remains, mopped up everywhere and sanitised the floor, what then?
Cleaning everything down and putting the thing back on immediately
showed up a problem: it still stank, and the stink was _in_ the
air-cooling system. Back in the day freezers had metal piping
everywhere attached to a heat exchange on the back.  Attached fridges
were cooled by blowing air up from the freezer compartment.  This
worked well, but they keep getting more efficient—so now we have a
single cooling array at the top of the freezer with a fan, and,
presumably, another for the fridge.[^2]

[^2]: In fact I think the fridge is purely passively cooled from the
    freezer.
	
According to the internet, if one's freezer is the site of meat decay
there are two options: a gradated treatment over several weeks of
various cleaners and [activated
carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_carbon) or buying a
new freezer.  Except I don't have several weeks, I have less than
48h.  And as for buying a new one; _well_. Looking through the
‘methods’ shows that they do two things: clean everything in sight as
thoroughly as possible, and vaporise something inside to work into
anything out of sight.  I figured if I took the whole thing apart I
could just clean everything by hand and have it done with.  

Here we go. First, take out the draws, trays, etc, and soak them in
the bath with washing up liquid (these have already been disinfected).
This is a bath: 
{{<figure src="/img/dscf1294.jpg" caption="This is a bath.  It's rarely full of freezer.">}}

Then unscrew everything in sight.  The screws were frozen solid and
needed the cordless drill. 

{{<figure src="/img/dscf1296.jpg" caption="On top is the cooling array.  Fan assembly removed.">}}

I've
taken the fan assembly away. It's in two parts: the fan itself, and a
polystyrene-clad tray which fits under the cooler:
{{<figure src="/img/dscf1297.jpg" caption="">}}

The fan assembly is simple: take plate out, remove the two
vibration-free rubber mounts and the blade, set them in neat bleach to
soak. Wipe the motor down (it's _probably_ immersion-proof—after all,
this is a freezer—but why risk
it?).

Wash plastic parts down with bleach and add to the bath. Now for the
tray: it seems the steel (?) plate is held in place with two bends at
the front:

{{<figure src="/img/dscf1303.jpg" caption="">}}

Bend those tabs and the whole thing can be removed. Here it is after
scrubbing, with the metal tray to the left. Under the tray is the
_heating_ element—yes, fridges contain heaters to periodically de-ice
the heat exchange. There's another element running around the array
itself, in a smaller tube. Also visible is the polystyrene insulation:
this stank. According to the internet, there's nothing you can do if
anything gets into the insulation. Hmm.

Now, how does one clean polystyrene? I rubbed
down with neat bleach and got all the surface mould off, but that's
not doing much. Of course, I could just spray-laquer it or something
and try to seal the smell _in_ but (1) I didn't think of it and (2)
I'm not sure how it would like the heating. Equally, I could make a
new one, but that would take at least a day with hot wire and
sandpaper to get anything like the original shape. Instead, here it is
soaking in an improvised bleach bath, weighed down with two paving
bricks:

Well, we'll see what that does. Meanwhile the drip tray had to be
removed and cleaned, and the exit pipe corked and filled with
‘plughole cleaner’:

The exif on those pictures is accurate. Time for dinner and bed. In
the morning, with great difficulty I took the box of water outside and
emptied it (water: 1kgdm^-1; there are a few bucketfuls in there). The
polystyrene stank much less. I took it up to the bath and washed it
down with detergent. It smelt even less, though that might be the
perfume in the detergent. Now, the polystyrene was held to the steel
with aluminium tape, which I threw away. Screwfix is just around the
corner, and, although it's a Sunday, this ox has fallen into a pit and
I'm _going tomorrow_. So a little Sunday shopping and we can start
taping it all back together:

{{<figure src="/img/dscf1309.jpg" caption="">}}

I taped the exit pipe on (which has a loop of heating element to
de-ice it), and had to take it all off again. Then back into the
plastic, bend the sheet down to fit, then back up to lock (?!) and
tape up everything—the less showing, the less smell, right?

{{<figure src="/img/dscf1312.jpg" caption="">}}

And all back into the freezer. Needless to say nothing would quite fit
and it was a wrestling match, but eventually:

{{<figure src="/img/dscf1313.jpg" caption="">}}

Shelves, draws back in. Turn on. Leave. Result: the air from the
cooling fan definitely doesn't stink any more. The whole thing smells,
well, not exactly fragrant, but no worse than a freezer sometimes
does. Now to get back to writing.

[^1]: Since credit added to the prepayment ‘smart’ meter I'm stuck
	with doesn't go on until you _press a button on the meter_.  What
    idiot designed that ‘feature’?  “It stops, erm, people maliciously
    paying each other’s bills!”
