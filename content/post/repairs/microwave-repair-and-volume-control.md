My microwave went on the blink, a few days before I got married.  It
started turning itself on, randomly, as soon as it was plugged in.
You could use it---I did in fact use it---by putting something inside,
waiting for it to turn on, and then opening the door after the
required time had elapsed.  Hardly ideal.  I unplugged it and left it
for later---there were other things to think about after all...

Fast forward a few months, and not having a microwave in one’s married
home is getting annoying.  I don’t use it much (and my wife hardly
uses it at all), but it _is_ easier to make hot chocolate in, and I
will stoop to cooking peas in it as well.  And reheating coffee.
Thus, time to take it all apart.  ([Last time I did
this](/post/repairs/microwave-repair) it was the cancel switch.  Plus
ça change...)

Here is the whole thing poked and prodded till we can get at the front
board:

and then, as before, to remove the offending switch and replace it
with another, which I cut to size from another old board as I don't
stock these things:

Whilst I was at it I fitted something all microwaves should have---a
potentiometer in series with the piezo speaker:

Now I can turn it down.  After years of being bothered by beepy
self-important electronics, I can finally get some peace...
