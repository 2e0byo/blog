One expects a student's life to have a certain ascesis to it.  One,
for instance, does not _buy_ rings for one's napkin, one _makes_ them.
And so I procured some cord (the seller considered me carefully and
then said that I had a face which permitted me to indulge in sailing,
which in turn justified buying cord to tie knots—‘Sailors fiddle’, she
said approvingly; though I cannot play the violin).  And I procured a
helpful video on the tying of 3-lead 8-bight Turks Heads, because I
can never remember any of these fancy knots. Yet being a student is no
cause for shoddy workmanship.  It seems I cannot recognise cotton, for
I tried a butane backsplice.  But lo! cotton does not melt.  So the
question is, how small a sailmaker's whipping can you
make?

That's pretty small.  And here they are:
