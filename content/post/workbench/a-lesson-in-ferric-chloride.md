FeCl3 is that stuff we use to etch circuit boards; apparently there
are other [uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_chloride) for
it too.  It etches most things, including, it would seem, the lid of
the jar I kept spent etchant in, the M10 studding on the bench
underneath, and most surprisingly for me—for my chemistry is rather
rusty—the plastic cap of the clamp on the shelf in front of it. 

Here's the damage control:

The studding was a mass of rust in the middle.  I hated to throw it,
so I took most off with a wire brush and then, lacking a die, re-cut
the thread with a nut, a spanner, and washing up liquid for a
lubricant.  Now that is why we store it _carefully_ in a large jar
with plenty of space...
