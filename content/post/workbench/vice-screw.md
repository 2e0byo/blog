About five years ago now I stopped dreaming of a proper bench vice and
built one from some old oak kitchen doors I rescued from a skip, an
old oak drawer, and long M6 bolts.

Some day if I find the pictures I
might write it up as an example of how _not_ to do it: I dovetailed
the two runners on in opposite directions and a whole host of other
things.  Still, it's a pretty good vice all told except for those M6
bolts. Of course we should use a proper thread designed for clamping,
but I've now left school so it's too late to cut one on one of the
lathes in the workshop, and have you _seen_ the prices?  I thought
about replacing it with M10 studding, as used in the bookbinder's
press, but there's not enough wood on the bottom of the jaws to do it
without extending them, and I've never got round to it.  So I view the
screws as expendable and replace them with studding when the thread
strips. 

Except that up till now I've epoxied a pair of locked nuts
into the wooden block on the end of the screw, but I don't think it'll
take another knock-out-and-re-glue cycle.  Really, if this is an
'expendable' it should be easier than that.  So when I tried to use
the vice and the thread jumped, I put aside whatever I was doing and
looked for a block of hardwood.  This is old 'hardwood windowsill'
saved from when they installed double glazing: the cowboys cut it in
half, badly, with a blunt pull saw, to make it easier to get out. They
were going to throw it, as well... 

There was a drawing, but I've lost
it.  The design is simplicity itself: a single nut is hammered into
one side of the block to form a captive nut, and a penny washer glued
into a recess over it to protect the vice jaws.  The studding passes
through, and then another nut and washer are tightened down on the
other side with a socket.  Lots of axial holes (thank goodness for the
pillar drill).  Also, it's _nice_ working hardwood—it's properly
dimensioned!

Then the block was cut into a rough hexagon and rounded with a simple
jig on the neighbour's disc sander (recess a bolt through a bit of
ply, clamp it to the table and spin the block on it).  If you don't
have access to a disk sander make it an _accurate_ hexagon and leave
it at that: it's all æsthetic
anyhow.

Assembled, and gluing the penny washer in with PVA.  This washer
really shouldn't have to do anything, but at least if the nut _does_
come loose it'll protect whatever's the other
side.

And then (after filing the cross-hole a bit because the internal nut
was _slightly_ proud), we can
re-assemble:

Yes, I need a new bench-hook.  And the slot the runners move in, which
keeps the jaws parallel, has worn a bit and should probably looked at
(hence the wedge to square it all up).  But that's for another day and
another post.

Update: the outer captive nut kept undoing at high tensions, driving
the studding into the handle.  I probably shouldn't tighten it that
much, but it's annoying, so I bought some loctite (blue), and glued
the nut on.  We'll have to see whether it holds, and whether it can be
undone next time it needs replacing.
