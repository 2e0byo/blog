What do you do with a broken zipper?  Especially early in the morning (i.e. around 1am).

Here is one way to repair a zip, preserving the latching effect to stop it
falling down by itself.  The wire rope (from ordinary copper stranded hookup
wire) pulls the latching tooth, and the fairlead (made from two very small
screws and some more wire soldered in place) converts enough of the tension into
downwards force to move the zip.  I have no idea how it has held up in practice,
as the coat is my mother's.
