I have a piano to tune. And also to restore: a few hammer shafts to
bend, hammers to file, a bit of crud to clean out, bridle straps to
replace, etc, etc. The piano cost £40 from Ebay and is in remarkably
good nick, and _any_ piano is better than none! But an out of tune
piano is no good.

Now students, I feel, should not really spend money
having their pianos tuned---at least, not students of Theology.[^1] But who
is to say I cannot tune it myself? So I read a few books (I am doing
an arts degree after all!) and websites, and it seems a moderately
competent person with a tuning meter can expect to do a _reasonable_
job in a day—the kind of job a tuner would do in half an hour. I'll
settle for that: it'll make things infintely more playable, and I
can't start work regulating an out-of-tune piano. It's just too
painful on the ear.
[^1]: This conviction has long been abandoned...

Now, to tune a piano you need a tuning lever. And
unlike harps, or harpsichords, you need a _long_ lever—those strings
are under enormous tension, and tuning with a harpsichord tuning key
is just not going to work (I tried). Unfortunately, piano tools are
woefully expensive, because there aren't enough piano tuners and
rebuilders in the world. At this point temptation came into play, and
I bought a cheap chinese 'piano tuning kit' off ebay, assuming that
rubber wedges (to mute the strings) are just wedges, and surely piano
tuning pin sizes are standardised?

Of course they are!  Internally. Every manufacturer seems to have used
their own size, and even today there are apparently competing
sizes... and of course, my cheapo lever just spun on the pins. I tried
to make a sheet metal insert to decrease the size of the tip: a
foolish idea which of course did not work. Then I spent many fruitless
hours trying to think of a way to make a new tip for it with only hand
tools in a kitchen, and came up with nothing. Theoretically one could
drill out a piece of mild steel, file it, polish it smooth, and then
harden it. But really, I've got a degree to do. So I bought the bullet
and bought an expensive but very well made tuning lever tip in the
same size from [Heckscher](http://www.heckscher.co.uk/tuning-levers/):
in fairness to the company, they're no cheaper anywhere else, there
just _isn't_ the market to make them cheaper.

Now, it would be nice if it just screwed into the M10/1 (fine, 1mm
pitch) thread on the chinese lever.  But of course it didn't.  So I
had several options: glue or weld it in place, buy the right lever, or
find something with the right thread.  The first two options would
cost about the same (I don't have a welding machine!), so the third
was preferrable.  After an enormous amount of head scratching and
purchasing a thread gauge I discovered it was a 3/8" 30TPI
'UNS'---american 60° metric-style threads but with imperial
dimensions.  And looking at the end of the lever, there might _just_
be enough metal under the thread to file it off and cut another.  A
die was sourced at very reasonable price from [Tracy
Tools](https://www.tracytools.com/) and I filed off the end:

cut a new thread:

and screwed on the tip:

It was a bit loose, but tightened up.  Of course, on the tuning pegs
it just came straight off again, and eventually stripped the very mild
steel lever.  So back to the workbench, this time to try the silly
project of filing a _new_ 3/8" rod from the end.  After cutting off
the old thread, here it is:

And of course, the die (with plenty of washing up liquid as a
threadcutting lubricant, and going slowly!) does a pretty good job of
rounding up the metal as it cuts:

Now that's a lovely thread.  The only thing I managed productively
that day—there are days like that—but a nice thread.  The new shoulder
isn't quite flat, but the tip tightened down and stuck on after a
little work, and I pulled the five or so notes which sounded out of
tune with themselves back into unisons. [^2]

[^2]: When the tuner got to it a month or so later he was _very_ confused.

If anyone else is in need of such a tool in similar straits: don't buy
a chinese lever, buy a tuning tip and a 3/8" 30TPI die, and then make
your own lever—and while you're at it, make it longer than this one.
Unless you're lucky enough to have a screwcutting lathe and can just
make an adaptor…
