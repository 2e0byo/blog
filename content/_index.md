This website [is not masterful](/page/about).  It is devoted to things
I do either because they need doing, or because I enjoy doing them,
and which someone else might possibly want to do.  Perhaps if my
mistakes are included here in enough detail someone else might not
make them...

I am not an engineer, or a software developer, or a mechanic, or a
carpenter, or a bookbinder, or anything else I might pretend to be on
these pages.  I am just an Amateur, but in real life Iâ€™m a PhD student
in Theology.  Except insofar as the aformentioned things I am not come
in to it, this is unlikely to be apparent here.

This website is purely static, and is the successor to [a wordpress
blog](/post/2020-09-28-leaving-wordpress).
